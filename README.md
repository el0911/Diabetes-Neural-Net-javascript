# Diabetetics Neural Net
A javascript & MATLAB neural network written to predict the possibility of having diabetes in percentile.  The training dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. 

# Required tools
* MATLAB Neural Net Toolbox: used to train the Neural Network.

# Current Stage
* Trained Models
* Utilized trained data in javascript library
* Support **PHP** to utilize library (enables live testing)
* Include ``` procfile``` for deployment on **Heroku**. Visit [Diabetics prediction heroku deployed](http://diabetics-prediction.herokuapp.com)

# Future plans
* Retrain the network using tenserflow and LSTM for better accuracy.

# Improvement
Visit [Kaggle: Pima Indians Diabetics Database](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) for better ways of training this model.
